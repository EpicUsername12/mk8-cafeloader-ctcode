# MK8 CTGP-Caf√© CafeLoader code 

This is currently v1.1.1 code

Using [**CafeLoader Project Compiler**](https://github.com/aboood40091/CafeLoader-Project-Compiler) by [**aboood40091**](https://github.com/aboood40091/CafeLoader-Project-Compiler)

It can also compile for Cemu (it produces a new game RPX) [**here**](https://github.com/aboood40091/CafeLoader-Project-Compiler/tree/cemu)
